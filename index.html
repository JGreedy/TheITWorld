	<h1><a name= "para2"></a>Interest In I.T</h1>
	<p>I am interested in I.T solely because of how vast and ever changing it is.
	Technology has the ability to change and be modified so it keeps up with the changing 
	environment it is based in. I am also very interested in I.T because of my passion to help others
	and I see I.T as the best opportunity to do so in many ways. My interest in I.T started at a very
	young age at around 4-5 and was heavily influenced by hand held game devices and my dad, who was a CNC
	programmer. I was brought up around a lot of technology, espically speakers because my dad loved to play music 
	and was always taking speakers apart and fixing them which exposed me to the inner technology of the speakers.
	Another main figure that really pushed and influenced me into loving technology was the Late Professor Stephen Hawking.
	His determination and intellect to try and help humanity through the use of technology has really inspired me into
	trying to learn as much as I can about tech and inturn teach and help others too. Some experience that I have in I.T I would
	say is that I completed a VET I.T course during High School which I finished in Year 11.</p>

	<p>I chose to come to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Techonolgy because as the title says it is a university well known
	for its involvement in advancing technology. I also chose to come to RMIT because of all the oppourtunities that they offer
	to students and how former students have always found success post graduation in the form of jobs or even business oppourtunities.
	RMIT was also one of the most convenient UNI's to get to which was perfect for me too, also I love the colour red which made it so much 
	easier to choose RMIT for all of my preferences.</p>
	
	<p>The most important thing I expect to learn from my studies at RMIT is everything I don't already know about technology. Since i was born 
	in a developing genereation which was heavily influced by technology, I am very familiar with everyday and modern electronics and can work with
	basic forms of technology. I also would love to learn how to do basic programming since it is a very important part of technology and the
	development of everything based around I.T. Finally the most important thing that I would love to learn which I think is very vital not only
	for I.T but for general life is the ability to communicate with others and the ability to work in groups to overcome tasks and problems. I have
	struggled with this in the past a lot which is why I'm looking forward to doing a lot of group assignments and projects to help me develop this ability.</p>

	<h1><a name= "para4"></a>Profile</h1>
	<h4>Myers-Briggs Test:</h4>
	<p>ENFJ [Extravert(19%), iNtuitive(47%), Feeling(6%), Judging(50%)]</p>	
	<p>I have slight preference of Extraversion over Introversion (19%)</p>
	<p>I have moderate preference of Intuition over Sensing (47%)</p>
	<p>I have slight preference of Feeling over Thinking (6%)</p>
	<p>I have moderate preference of Judging over Perceiving (50%)</p>
	<h4>Learning Style Test:</h4>
	<p>Auditory/Visual Learner (Auditory: 35%, Visual: 35%, Tacticle: 30%)</p>
	<h5>Auditory:</h5>
	<p>I learn by hearing and listening. I understand and remember things I've heard. 
	I store information by the way it sounds, and have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones.
	I often learn by reading out loud because I have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.
	As an auditory learner, I sometimes hum or talk to myself or others if I become bored. 
	People may think I'm not paying attention, even though I may be hearing and understanding everything being said.</p>
	<h5>Visual:</h5>
	<p>I also learn by reading or seeing pictures. I understand and remember things by sight. 
	I can picture what I'm learning in my head, and I learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. 
	I like to see what I'm learning.As a visual learner, I'm usually neat and clean. 
	I often close my eyes to visualize or remember something, and I will find something to watch if I become bored. 
	I may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. 
	I'm attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>
	<h4>Strength Test:</h4>
	<p>Optimism(88%)	Self Motivation(81%)	Innovation(81%)		Team Work(81%)		Visionary(81%)	Problem Solving(75%) Integrity(63%) Determinatoin(75%) Leadership(75%) Risk Taking(75%)</p>
	<h4>Meaning Of Results:</h4>	
	<p>These test results in a way confirms what I already knew about myself and also has opened up new aspects of my personality and strengths 
	that I didn't know about and possess. These results and information boosts my self esteem and pushes me to perform well in working with others
	and also gives me confidence in the ability to lead a group or team in completing tasks and overcoming problems. It also gives me a better sense
	and understanding of how well I can work to solve a problem and what type of steps I need to take to overcome them. All this information will be
	really useful when forming a team as I can take into account my strengths and weaknesses to find people who I can work well with who have 
	different strenghts and weaknesses to form a really strong group which by working together with their different abilities can overcome problems and	
	solve tasks. 
	<h1><a name= "para5"></a>Project Ideas</h1>
	<h4>Overview:</h4>
	<p>A project idea that I had includes the creation and development of an app which helps specifically basketball players and enthusiasts who play the game. 
	It will be an app that uses location services to help players who are looking for a basketball court to find the nearest one near them. 	
	It will also classify each court in a detailed description, by type of court, indoor or outdoor, half or full etc. 
	The app will also tell users if other players are at any specific court and notify them if any friends that have the app are at any courts near their location.</p>
	<h4>Motivation:</h4>
	<p>This project would be interesting because basketball is one the most played sports around the world and its still growing. 
	This app would in turn then be used by millions who are looking for free basketball courts to play on. 
	It would also be interesting to expand the brand of basketball with the use of this app and maybe even team up with the NBA to improve the app and give users a better experience in the world of basketball. 
	I’m also motivated by this project because I’m a player myself and know the struggles that go into finding a free basketball court to train and play on.</p>
	<h4>Description:</h4>
	<p>The app will be free and only available on mobile devices. It will have a home/dashboard which will have the main actions to be performed by the app at the ready. Main actions include, “Find Courts Nearby” where users can click to initiate the apps location services to find the nearest courts around them, “Favourite Courts” is a list of courts the user has favorited and can quickly look up to  see if its free or any friends are near them. Another feature of the app could be a news tab, where users can go to see all the latest stories related to basketball, this feature could be supported by the NBA in supplying stories for the app. A side feature of the app would also be the friends section where uses can add other people that use the app and meet up to play games of basketball or just train. The important part of this app would be the “Add Court” section. This section of the app will allow users who find a basketball court that isn’t featured on the apps map to add that court to be displayed. The users 
	application of a new court will go through a verification process. They will have to provide visual evidence of a court being situated at the specified location, and also some extra details that describe the court and its surroundings. Also a feature that is important just like the “Add Court”, is the “Check In” section of the app. This feature allows users to check in when they are near or at a basketball court that is featured on the app. This helps to notify other users of which courts are full or free and hence help them to pick courts to go to that aren’t already occupied, which is a really important part of the app and its success. The app will also allow users to either sign up with facebook, google or a special sign up through the app using an email.</p>
	<h4>Tools & Technologies:</h4>
	<p>For the software required to develop this app I’m not sure what might be needed but I’d say Eclipse to write the coding for the apps functions. However the hardware required is a mobile device which will be used to test the app before it being finalised. A laptop or PC will be required to develop the app and other specifications required outside the app. Other than that I’m actually not sure what hardware and software is also required but I’m pretty sure there would be more.</p>
	<h4>Skills Required:</h4>
	<p>Some skills required is the ability to know how to code using eclipse and also how to program using a variety of software’s. Other skills that are not I.T related but required is the ability to communicate and sell the idea to users and possible partners. These skills would be easy to find if a very diverse group is formed to work on the project. A person who can communicate well and is good at talking to new people could be put in charge for all the pitching and transferring of information from the group to outsiders in general terms. Where as people who are good with programming and coding can be in charge of all the technological work behind the development of the app.</p>
	<h4>Outcome:</h4>
	<p>If the app is successful, even with a small group, it’s a good outcome as word will spread quickly among players and therefore take off from there. Also the app would be a relief for players and the hunt to find empty courts quickly. It would save them to struggle of going from court to court only to find them full and not have a chance to train. Players will find relief in using this app as it shows them every court near them and their availability so it helps them to speed up the search and in turn gives them more time to train and/or play. </p>
